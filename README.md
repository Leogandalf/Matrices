# Matrices
A fun experiment with Object Oriented programming in C++  

This project has the objective of learning OOP in C++ and too improve my code wring day by day.  

## What should the final output be?
I'd like to say that the final output shold be a Matrix calculator for some of the main operations you'd like a computer to do for you.  
Such as:
- matrix sum
- matrix multiplication
- calculating the determinant
- calculating the rank
- calculating the inverted matrix
- other...

I'd also like to learn using a graphic interface, nothing too cool, just to be able to see in a decent way what is actually going on when opening the program.
